## Usage

Install Node packages and start the backend server  

```bash
npm install
npm run devStart
```

To start the html server

```bash
python3 -m http.server --cgi 5000
```

Then you would be able to see the app at http://localhost:5000.
If you open multiiple tabs, you would be able to "communicate" with each other to see each other's progress.
